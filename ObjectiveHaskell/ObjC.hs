Operator to simplify and clarify messaging syntax. This code:

@
    somethingWithTwoArguments :: Id -> Id -> Id -> IO Id
    somethingWithTwoArguments a b str = â€¦

    f :: Id -> Id -> Id -> IO Id
    f str a b = somethingWithTwoArguments a b str
@

becomes:

@
    f str a b = str @. somethingWithTwoArguments a b
@

(@.) = flip ($)
